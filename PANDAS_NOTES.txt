- Think of a pandas dataset as a numpy array with names for row and column numbers! That is a dict + numpy array!

- - Columns labels are like dict keys, while row names are called indices (as opposed to conventional indices) in DF.

- To select a list of columns, give in a list as the conventional index! If you want a list of rows and list of columns then give both as lists.

- iloc is integer based location. Normal loc is key based location. Also iloc can take in step values (as usual it is the 3rd slice)

- pd.DataFrame({}) -> adds series as columns with keys as names. pd.DataFrame([]) -> adds series as rows

- dropna, fillna to drop nulls and fill nulls

- Series + n-level Indices is a n*n matrix in 1d!! 
	+ This requires xs to slice through

- Merging:
	+ Based on Keys or Indices or combo - left_on, right_on or left_index = bool, right_index = bool
	+ JOINS - how option in merge command

- Join:
	+ Useful because more than two dfs can be passed in simultaneously uinlike merge
	
- Concat
	+ Based on multiple dfs in terms of rows or columns!!
	+ Can help create multiindices

- Stack, Unstack = DF -> Series and Series -> DF
	+ Stack->Unstack = Transpose!
